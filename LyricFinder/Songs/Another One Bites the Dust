Another One Bites the Dust;
Queen;


Oh lets go
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Aint no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready hey are you ready for this 
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey Im gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think Im going to get along
Without you when youre gone 
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy are you satisfied 
How long can you stand the heat 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey Im gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Hey
Oh take it
Bite the dust
Bite the dust
Hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust oww
Another one bites the dust hey hey
Another one bites the dust eh eh
Oh shooter
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him when hes down
But Im ready yes Im ready for you
Im standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat oh yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey Im gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Oh shooter hey hey all right;
