Thriller;
Michael Jackson;

Its close to midnight;
Something evils lurking from the dark;
Under the moonlight;
You see a sight that almost stops your heart;
You try to scream;
But terror takes the sound before you make it;
You start to freeze;
As horror looks you right between your eyes;
Youre paralyzed;
Cause this is thriller;
Thriller night;
And no one’s gonna save you;
From the beast about to strike;
You know it’s thriller;
Thriller night;
Youre fighting for your life;
Inside a killer thriller tonight yeah;
Im gonna bring it tonight;
You hear the door slam;
And realize theres nowhere left to run;
You feel the cold hand;
And wonder if youll ever see the sun;
You close your eyes;
And hope that this is just imagination;
Girl but all the while;
You hear a creature creeping up behind;
Youre out of time;
Cause this is thriller;
Thriller night;
And no one’s gonna save you;
From the beast about to strike;
You know its thriller;
Thriller night;
You’re fighting for your life;
Inside a killer thriller tonight;
Im gonna thrill ya tonight;
Get up get up;
Darkness falls across the land;
The midnight hour is close at hand;
Creatures crawl in search of blood;
To terrorize yalls neighborhood;
And whosoever shall be found;
Without the soul for getting down;
Must stand and face the hounds of hell;
And rot inside a corpses shell;
Im gonna thrill ya tonight;
Im gonna thrill ya tonight; 
Ooh babe;
Im gonna thrill ya tonight;
Cause this is thriller;
Cause this is thriller;
Cause this is thriller;
Cause this is thriller;
Get up get up;
Im gonna thrill you tonight;
Im gonna thrill you tonight;
Im gonna thrill you tonight;
Cause this is thriller;
