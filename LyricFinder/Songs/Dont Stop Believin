Dont Stop Believin;
Journey;

just a small town girl;
livin in a lonely world;
she took the midnight train goin anywhere;
just a city boy;
born and raised in south detroit;
he took the midnight train goin anywhere;
a singer in a smokey room;
the smell of wine and cheap perfume;
for a smile they can share the night;
it goes on and on and on and on;
strangers waiting;
up and down the boulevard;
their shadows searching in the night;
streetlight people;
living just to find emotion;
hiding somewhere in the night;
working hard to get my fill;
everybody wants a thrill;
payin anything to roll the dice;
just one more time;
some will win some will lose;
some were born to sing the blues;
oh the movie never ends;
it goes on and on and on and on;
strangers waiting;
up and down the boulevard;
their shadows searching in the night;
streetlight people;
living just to find emotion;
hiding somewhere in the night;
dont stop believin;
hold on to the feelin;
streetlight people;
