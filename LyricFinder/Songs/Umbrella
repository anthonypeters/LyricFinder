Rihanna;

Uh huh uh huh;
Yeah Rihanna;
Uh huh uh huh; 
Good girl gone bad;
Uh huh uh huh;
Take three action;
Uh huh uh huh ho;
No clouds in my stones;
Let it rain I hydroplane into fame;
Comin down at the Dow Jones;
When the clouds come we gone;
We Rocafella;
We fly higher than weather;
In G5s or better;
You know me;
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day;
Rain man is back with little Ms. Sunshine;
Rihanna where you at;
You have my heart and well never be worlds apart;
Maybe in magazines but youll still be my star;
Baby cause in the dark;
You cant see shiny cars;
And thats when you need me there;
With you Ill always share;
Because When the sun shines we shine together;
Told you Ill be here forever;
Said Ill always be your friend;
Took an oath that Im a stick it out til the end;
Now that its raining more than ever;
Know that we still have each other;
You can stand under my umbrella;
You can stand under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh;
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh;
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh;
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh;
These fancy things will never come in between;
Youre part of my entity here for infinity;
When the world has took its part;
When the world has dealt its cards;
If the hand is hard together well mend your heart;
Because You can run into my arms;
Its okay dont be alarmed;
(Come into me);
(Theres no distance in between our love);
So Im gonna let the rain pour;
Ill be all you need and more;
Because Its raining raining;
Ooh baby its raining raining;
Baby come into me;
Come into me;
Its raining raining;
Ooh baby its raining raining;
You can always come into me;
Come into me;
Its pouring rain;
Its pouring rain;
Come into me;
Come into me;
Its pouring rain;
Its pouring rain;
