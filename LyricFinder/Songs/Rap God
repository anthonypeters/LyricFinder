Rap God;
Eminem;

Look I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings;
But Im only going to get this one chance;
Somethings wrong I can feel it (Six minutes Slim Shady youre on);
Just a feeling Ive got like somethings about to happen but I dont know what;
If that means what I think it means were in trouble big trouble;
And if he is as bananas as you say Im not taking any chances;
You were just what the doctor ordered;
Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God;
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod;
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box;
They said I rap like a robot so call me Rapbot;
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes;
I got a laptop in my back pocket;
My penll go off when I half-cock it;
Got a fat knot from that rap profit;
Made a living and a killing off it;
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office;
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack;
Im an MC still as honest;
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables killaholic (Kill em all with);
This slickety gibbedy hibbedy hip hop;
You dont really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy brat;
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac backpack rap crap yep yackidy-yac;
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicing;
That Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table;
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half;
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact;
How could I not blow All I do is drop F-bombs feel my wrath of attack;
Rappers are having a rough time period heres a Maxipad;
Its actually disastrously bad;
For the wack while Im masterfully constructing this masterpiece as;
Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God;
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod;
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box;
Let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard;
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got;
Well to be truthful the blueprints simply rage and youthful exuberance;
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance;
Hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the moon since;
MCs get taken to school with this music;
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme;
Now I lead a new school full of students;
Me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz 2Pac N-;
-WA Cube hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim;
Inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position;
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin Rock n;
Roll Hall of Fame;
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames;
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame;
On the wall of shame;
You fags think its all a game til I walk a flock of flames;
Off of planking tell me what in the fuck are you thinking;
Little gay looking boy;
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy;
You witnessing a mass occur;
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy;
Oy vey that boys gay thats all they say looking boy;
You get a thumbs up pat on the back;
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy;
Hey looking boy what you say looking boy;
I got a hell yeah from Dre looking boy;
Imma work for everything I have;
Never ask nobody for shit get outa my face looking boy;
Basically boy youre never gonna be capable;
To keep up with the same pace looking boy;
Cause Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God;
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod;
The way Im racing around the track call me Nascar Nascar;
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God;
Kneel before General Zod this planets Krypton no Asgard Asgard;
So you be Thor and Ill be Odin you rodent Im omnipotent;
Let off then Im reloading immediately with these bombs Im totin;
And I should not be woken;
Im the walking dead but Im just a talking head a zombie floating;
But I got your mom deep throating;
Im out my Ramen noodle we have nothing in common poodle;
Im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil;
Its me my honestys brutal;
But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though;
For good at least once in a while;
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle;
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times;
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned;
Rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime;
I know there was a time where once I;
Was king of the underground but I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind;
So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine;
Appeal with the skin color of mine;
You get too big and here they come trying to;
Censor you like that one line I said on Im Back from the Mathers LP;
One when I tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine;
Put em all in a line add an AK-47 a revolver and a nine;
See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was but Im;
Morphin into an immortal coming through the portal;
Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though;
And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for;
Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows;
You write normal fuck being normal;
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future;
Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad;
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhethers pad;
Singin to a man while they played piano;
Man oh man that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel;
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day;
Hey Fab Imma kill you;
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (JJ Fad);
Uh sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming Im a human;
What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman;
Innovative and Im made of rubber;
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and itll glue to you;
Im devastating more than ever demonstrating;
How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating;
Never fading and I know that the haters are forever waiting;
For the day that they can say I fell off theyd be celebrating;
Cause I know the way to get em motivated;
I make elevating music you make elevator music;
Oh hes too mainstream;
Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it;
Its not hip hop its pop cause I found a hella way to fuse it;
With rock shock rap with Doc;
Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it;
I dont know how to make songs like that;
I dont know what words to use;
Let me know when it occurs to you;
While Im ripping any one of these verses diverse as you;
Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you;
How many verses I gotta murder to;
Prove that if you were half as nice your songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh;
School flunkie pill junky;
But look at the accolades the skills brung me;
Full of myself but still hungry;
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to;
And Im a million leagues above you ill when I speak in tongues;
But its still tongue in cheek fuck you;
Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel Im asleep in the front seat;
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys still chunky but funky;
But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling;
Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me;
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate;
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have;
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation;
And understand the discrimination;
But fuck it lifes handing you lemons make lemonade then;
But if I cant batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then;
Dont mistake it for Satan;
Its a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas;
And take a vacation to trip a broad;
And make her fall on her face and dont be a retard;
Be a king Think not why be a king when you can be a God;
